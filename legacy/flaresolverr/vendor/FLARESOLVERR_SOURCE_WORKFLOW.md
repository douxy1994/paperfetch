# FlareSolverr Source Workflow

## Goal

Run the FlareSolverr source workflow with the preset that matches your host.

The script default is now the portable headless preset:

- official upstream source code
- `HEADLESS=true`
- `Xvfb`
- no Docker sidecar dependency

On this specific WSLg host, the verified working route is still the explicit WSLg preset `.env.flaresolverr-source-wslg`.
The portable headless default is kept for better reuse on desktop Linux and headless servers, but on this host the official `Xvfb` route can fail because `/tmp/.X11-unix` is mounted read-only.

## Recommended Presets

| Environment | Recommended preset | Mode | Why this is the default recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WSLg | `.env.flaresolverr-source-wslg` | `HEADLESS=false` | Best when you explicitly want the visible WSLg browser path and interactive debugging. |
| Desktop Linux | `.env.flaresolverr-source-headless` | `HEADLESS=true` + `Xvfb` | More portable for long-running background use and less dependent on the current desktop session state. |
| Headless server | `.env.flaresolverr-source-headless` | `HEADLESS=true` + `Xvfb` | Best fit for SSH, systemd, tmux, CI, and machines with no real display session. |

## One-Time Setup

```bash
cd /home/dictation/test
bash ./setup_flaresolverr_source.sh
```

The default preset in this directory is `.env.flaresolverr-source-headless`.
Because that preset uses `HEADLESS=true`, make sure the `Xvfb` binary is installed first.
On Debian/Ubuntu systems, that usually means installing the `xvfb` package:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y xvfb
```

The explicit WSLg preset in this directory is `.env.flaresolverr-source-wslg`.
That preset uses `HEADLESS=false`, so it does not rely on `Xvfb`.
On this host, that explicit WSLg preset remains the verified local path.

The setup script creates or reuses a repo-local branch for the official
FlareSolverr tag, then applies the repo-local `patches/return-image-payload.patch`
extension and commits it inside the working clone. If an existing checkout already
contains the `returnImagePayload` / `imagePayload` extension, setup reuses that
checkout and preserves tracked local edits. If the extension is missing and
tracked local edits exist, setup refuses to reset the checkout so custom
FlareSolverr changes are not lost. The image payload patch exports bitmap image
documents through canvas and serializes top-level SVG documents as
`image/svg+xml`, while callers still reject non-image challenge HTML.

## Main Chain

The scripts now default to the headless preset, but the verified chain on this host still uses the explicit WSLg preset:

```bash
cd /home/dictation/test
bash ./start_flaresolverr_source.sh ./.env.flaresolverr-source-wslg
```

When `HEADLESS=false`, the start script launches FlareSolverr through `script` so the headful browser keeps a PTY even in background mode.
The startup probe also bypasses shell proxy settings, so `127.0.0.1:8191` is checked directly instead of through a local HTTP proxy.

## Use With fetch_fulltext.py

After the WSLg service is up on `http://127.0.0.1:8191/v1`, `fetch_fulltext.py` can use it as an optional HTML backend:

```bash
cd /home/dictation/test
python fetch_fulltext.py \
  --input your.csv \
  --output-dir out \
  --html-fetcher flaresolverr \
  --enable-pdf-fallback \
  --flaresolverr-url http://127.0.0.1:8191/v1
```

Default behavior is unchanged. If you do not pass `--html-fetcher flaresolverr`, the script still uses the existing Playwright HTML path.

For PNAS-like cases where the HTML route lands on an abstract page, `--enable-pdf-fallback` now reuses the FlareSolverr-solved cookies and user-agent to seed the Playwright browser context before downloading the PDF.

## Verified Results On This Host

As of 2026-04-14, this workflow has been rechecked on this host with recent `Science` DOIs:

- `10.1126/science.aeg3511` -> `success_html`
- `10.1126/science.ady3136` -> `success_html`

For the tested `Science` URLs, plain `curl` still hit a Cloudflare challenge, but the explicit WSLg FlareSolverr path was able to fetch the `/doi/full/...` HTML successfully.

The previously kept `PNAS` behavior remains relevant: some `PNAS` HTML routes can still land on abstract pages, so `--enable-pdf-fallback` should still be treated as part of the normal command for those targets.

## Start The Service

```bash
cd /home/dictation/test
bash ./start_flaresolverr_source.sh ./.env.flaresolverr-source-wslg
```

Important dependency note:

- `HEADLESS=true` requires the `Xvfb` package and an available `Xvfb` binary
- the WSLg preset here uses `HEADLESS=false`, so it uses the WSLg display instead of `Xvfb`
- on this host, use the WSLg preset explicitly if the default headless preset fails with the read-only `/tmp/.X11-unix` error

If you want to probe the service manually, bypass proxies for the local control port:

```bash
curl --noproxy '*' -fsS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8191/v1 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"cmd":"sessions.list"}'
```

## Stop The Service

```bash
cd /home/dictation/test
bash ./stop_flaresolverr_source.sh
```

## Foreground Mode

```bash
cd /home/dictation/test
bash ./run_flaresolverr_source.sh
```
